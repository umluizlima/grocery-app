# Grocery App
> Keep your grocery list with this simple webapp.

Grocery App is a practice project built with **Flask**. Index is the only page served by the backend, while all other interactions with the app are made via asynchrounous javascript requests to its API endpoints, with data passed through JSON, and HTML editing through javascript.

You can check a live version at [Heroku](https://flask-grocery-app.herokuapp.com).

## Features

* Add a new item to the list
* Edit it's name
* Mark it as done or undone (check/uncheck)
* Remove it from the list
